# Key Roles of checkpointLocation
# 1. Fault Tolerance & Recovery: f your Spark application fails (due to a cluster crash, JVM error, or network issue), Spark uses the data in the checkpoint directory to resume processing.
# 2. Maintain State Information for stateful transformations: For stateful queries (like window(), groupBy(), or dropDuplicates()), Spark must remember intermediate results (e.g., a running count). It saves this "state" into the checkpoint location so that if the job restarts, the running totals aren't lost.
# 3. Exactly-once semantics for output sinks that support it.
